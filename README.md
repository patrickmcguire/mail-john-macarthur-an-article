A way to print out and email John MacAurthur any article you feel like mailing him, since he doesn't use the Internet.

Requires wget which you almost certainly have, and wkhtmltopdf, which you probably don't.

run ./mail.bash urlToSendToJohnMacAurthur to send it

You'll need to actually make an account and put the basic auth in line 3, but it works.
